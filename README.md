# Analysis of Starcraft 2 e-Sports 

This repository, created in response to a Data Challenge for [Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/), contains a proposal for an inquiry into Starcraft e-Sports and some preliminary data analysis. My submission was as below.

I would like to propose to use the Aligulac database of Starcraft tournaments to find out how to best sustain a community around and monetize a competetively-played video game. 

Released in 2010, Starcraft 2 is a real-time strategy game, the first game to become a popular e-Sport outside of South Korea. It has a regularly run tournament schedule, with total player earnings reaching around 30$ million as of 2019. The Aligulac project, available at http://aligulac.com/, maintains a comprehensive database of Starcraft players, teams, matches, tournaments and prizes.
