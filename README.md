# Analysis of Starcraft 2 e-Sports 

This repository, created in response to a Data Challenge for [Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/), contains a proposal for an inquiry into Starcraft e-Sports and some preliminary data analysis. My submission was as below.

I would like to propose to use the Aligulac database of Starcraft tournaments to find out how to best sustain a community around and monetize a competitively-played video game. 

Released in 2010, Starcraft 2 is a real-time strategy game, the first game to become a popular e-Sport outside of South Korea. It has a regularly run tournament schedule, with total player earnings reaching around 30$ million as of 2019. The Aligulac project, available at http://aligulac.com/, maintains a comprehensive database of Starcraft players, teams, matches, tournaments and prizes. 

Nowadays, it is common for publishers to try to establish an e-Sport scene for their new video games as a way to drive player engagement, keeping them playing the game for an established period of time. Using the Aligulac database, one can try to analyze which factors help sustain a healthy community, with a large amount of players playing the game professionally, and a large viewership. Some of the questions one can try to answer are as follows: 
- Starcraft 2 e-Sports had a relatively tumultuous history, with release of several new expansions, a [match-fixing scandal](https://www.pcgamer.com/eight-arrested-in-starcraft-ii-match-fixing-scandal/), introduction of a region lock and passage to a free-to-play model. How did these developments affect the amount of tournaments and competitively played games, at both high- and mid-levels? 
- How is the popularity of the game as an e-Sport correlated with the amount of players playing the game non-competitively? How is it correlated with viewership? 
- Starcraft competition can be divided into two partially separate ecosystems, the Korean and the "foreign" (non-Korean) one, each with its own set of players, teams and tournament systems. How do these compare to each other over time, in particular, how do the different levels of outside investment affect them? 
- Depending on the amount of prizes, how long does an e-Sport career usually last? What kind of financial incentives are needed to ensure that players keep engaging into the game professionally? What is the effect of teams, considering that Starcraft is a 1v1-game? 

As a preliminary data analysis, I prepared two plots: 
- [https://github.com/pstragowskipiotr/Starcraft-e-Sport-analysis/blob/master/Popularity%20over%20time%20and%20in-outside%20Korea%20.ipynb](A bar graph presenting the popularity of the game as an e-Sport in different regions with important changes labeled)
- [https://github.com/pstragowskipiotr/Starcraft-e-Sport-analysis/blob/master/Career%20earnings%20over%20age.ipynb](A scatter plot of player earnings throughout their career against their age and nationality)
